# Walkie Talkie: Tuesday, June 3rd. 

In breakout groups of 2-4 people each, you will **pair program** through **exploratory data analysis** of `survey.csv`, in this repo. 

Elect one person to **screenshare** and **type**, the others will help **verbally**. 

As a group, write up a **report** that describes the data visually and statistically. List all the names of the people who collaborated on it in a byline. 

_Fork this repo_ and commit your notebook into your fork, be sure to place it in the `0603` subdirectory.
