# hobbies
icebreaker activity for data science 5

Today we will go into _breakout groups_

Think of a *hobby* or *job* from your life. Try to model it as a data story.

1. Write a set of columns and what those columns represent/track, a single table or multiple tables for this model. Only write columns that you know how to collect data for.
2. If data is _missing_ in any column, what does that mean?
3. What _is not_ represented in your model?

Fork the `hobbies` repository https://github.com/quinn-dougherty/hobbies, click `Create new file` and call it `your-name.md`. Jot down notes while you think about your answer, commit it to your fork, and submit a pull request (all of which I'll demonstrate before we begin).

Talk it over in your breakout group and listen to your peers' ideas before writing anything down. We'll meet back at `8:40Î»` so *two* people can share their results before we take a break in advance of lecture.
